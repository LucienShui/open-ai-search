# Open AI Search

> This project is still under heavy development.

Open AI Search, inspired by perplexity and metaso.

## Usage

```shell
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Demo

> Using free `gpt-3.5-turbo` from [GPT_API_free](https://github.com/chatanywhere/GPT_API_free).  
Maybe you need to wait for the first response token up to 10 seconds.  
Deploy with your own openai api would be faster.
